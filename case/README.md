# 3liza case

### These files are meant for 3D printing only! 

They are not suitable for CNC machining and trying to use them for that will most likely result in failure of the parts.  
The plate is split in to two pieces for easier printing on smaller printers.

To assemble the board you need 6x m2x4mm heat set inserts and 6x m2x6mm screws.
For mounting the plate in the case 16x 2mm thick foam strips should be used as gaskets.
